# Llama-RAG-Pipeline-Building

This repository contains code and data for building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using the **Llama Index**. RAG is a neural text generation model that enhances output quality by leveraging large-scale knowledge sources. The Llama Index is a scalable approximate nearest neighbor search engine designed to efficiently retrieve relevant documents from extensive corpora.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or higher
- Transformers 4.5 or higher
- Faiss 1.7 or higher
- Llama 0.1 or higher

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, execute:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
