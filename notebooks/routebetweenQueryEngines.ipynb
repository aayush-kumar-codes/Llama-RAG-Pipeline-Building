    "1. **ListIndex:**\n",
    "   - `ListIndex` is a data structure that represents a list of items. In the context of the provided code, it seems to be used to index and organize nodes obtained from a document. The nodes likely represent some structural or semantic elements within the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **tree_summarize:**\n",
    "   - `tree_summarize` is a response mode for the list query engine. It suggests that the query engine is expected to provide a summarized response in a tree-like structure. The specifics of what this entails would depend on the implementation details of the query engine, but it generally implies a hierarchical and structured summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **RouterQueryEngine:**\n",
    "   - `RouterQueryEngine` is a query engine that routes queries to different sub-engines based on certain criteria. In the provided code, two instances of `RouterQueryEngine` are created, each with a different selector (`PydanticSingleSelector` and `LLMSingleSelector`) and the same query engine tools (`list_tool` and `vector_tool`). This means that the router can direct queries to different query engines based on the type of selector used.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - The `RouterQueryEngine` is configured to use a selector (which likely determines the type or format of the query) and a set of query engine tools (such as `list_tool` and `vector_tool) that define how to process and respond to queries.\n",
